This image was inspired by the work done by Mark Shust at https://github.com/mageinferno/docker-magento2-php

The Mage Inferno setup bundles composer and grunt in with the PHP image. In this configuration
the host machine is expected to handle composing the code base and a separate image is used
to run Grunt.
